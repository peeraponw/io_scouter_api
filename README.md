# Intro
Thailand has been damaged by Junta who has reigned the country since 2014. They contain their power in different aspects - army, law, information, etc. to tame the citizens. In the current era, the information aspect plays a crucial role in this manner. They have founded an Information Operation (IO) by drafting sodiers, who are supposed to serve the public, to spam, flood, input fake news into social media systems, for examples, Twitter. As one can tweet fake news and the text becomes viral quite easily, it is vulnerable to those who has limited digital literacy. Therefore, this app takes the tweet text in Thai as its input in order to return the probability of being fake news as an output.


This is a Flask webapp which is hosted on Heroku. Please find it at https://io-scouter-api.herokuapp.com/api. It takes `text` argument as input and return the probability of this text being typed by an IO (Information Operation).
